# MyWaypoints

## Easily configurable plugin to manage multiple waypoints on the server!

Each waypoint is described by YAML files, e.g:
Mesa.yaml:
```
name: Mesa
description: Entrance to Mesa biome!
location:
  x: -347
  y: 64
  z: 527
```



## Commands
`/waypoint list` - lists all available waypoints

`/waypoint add name` - adds new `name` waypoint with user's current location

`/waypoint edit name` - saves user's current location as new location for waypoint with given name

`/waypoint delete name` - deletes waypoint with given name
